[TraineesBlog blogging features](https://trainees.cn/project/TraineesBlog) are powered by the [程序员菜鲲](https://trainees.cn/bcxmd).

Simply add Markdown files (or folders) to the `TraineesBlog` directory.

Regular blog authors can be added to `authors.yml`.

The blog post date can be extracted from filenames, such as:
    
- `2019-05-30-welcome.md`
- `2019-05-30-welcome/index.md`

A blog post folder can be convenient to co-locate blog post images:

![TraineesBlog Plushie](./TraineesBlog-Plushie-Banner.png)

The blog supports tags as well!

**And if you don't want a blog**: just delete this directory, and use `blog: false` in your TraineesBlog config.
